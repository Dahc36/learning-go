	// Indexes 14, 15 and 16 will be skipped over as ðŸŒž takes up 4 bytes to write.
	// This is because for-range iterates over the runes, not the bytes.
	// Multibyte runes are converted to a single 32-bit number (from their UTF-8 representation)
	// and the offset is incremented by the number of bytes in the rune.
	// If the loop encounters a byte that doesn't represent a valid UTF-8 value,
	// the Unicode replacement character (0xfffd) is returned instead

	// for-range values are copies
