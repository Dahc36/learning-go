	// This is because for-range iterates over the string's runes, not the bytes.
	// Multibyte runes are converted to a single 32-bit number (from their UTF-8 representation)
	// and the offset is incremented by the number of bytes in the rune.
	// If the loop encounters a byte that doesn't represent a valid UTF-8 value,
	// the Unicode replacement character (0xfffd) is returned instead

	// for-range values are copies

	// When to use each for loop
	// - for-range is the best way of iterating through the entire content of a compound type
	// - The c-style loop is useful when you only want to iterate a sub-section
	//   - Be careful that this won't work when iterating strings! (because of the bytes vs runes)
	// - The conditional for replaces the classic "while" statement
	// - The infinite for can replicate the "do-while" pattern and implement the iterator pattern

	// - There's no fallthrough by default on every case
	//   - If you want fallthrough you can use the fallthrough keyword but try to avoid it refactoring
	// - Cases with empty bodies just don't do anything
	// - break statements are not necessary but you can use them
	//   - Try to avoid and refactor
	//   - You may want to break out of an outer loop from inside a case, you'll need to label that loop

	// 2. You can't jump into an inner or parallel block
